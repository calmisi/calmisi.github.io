## **About Me** ##
- At 2016-10-28
 I am now a second-year M.Eng. candidate in Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, Hubei province.
 What i do everyday is just killing time. But i realise i have to do somethings to avoid starving to death after i grauate, so i start to construct this site. I konw, it's just a beginning.

- At 2018-9-16

 It's lucky that I graduated from HUST, and I am now a software engineer working at OTC (open technology center) of Intel. 
 Thanks to my company, it doesn't demand work overtime and spares enough personal and off-the-office time for me to do what I like.
 So I think it's time for me to work on it again. What'r more, I want to make this website more wonderful.
